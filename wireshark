 Display Filters in Wireshark (used after capturing) 
1. ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 
 This filter shows all packets where the given IP is either the source or destination. 
 
2. ip.src == 192.168.1.1 
 This displays only packets sent from the specific IP address. 
 
3. ip.dst == 192.168.1.1 
 This displays only packets to the specific IP address. 
 
4. tcp 
 Shows only packets using the TCP protocol, filtering out UDP, ICMP, etc. 
 
5. udp 
 Displays only UDP protocol packets. 
 
6. icmp 
 Shows only ICMP packets, typically used for ping and network diagnostics. 
 
7. http 
 Displays only packets that are part of HTTP communications (usually port 80). 
 
8. tcp.port == 443 
 Filters packets sent over HTTPS (secure web traffic). 
 
9. tcp.flags.syn == 1 
 Shows TCP packets with the SYN flag, used when a connection is being initiated. 
 
10. tcp.flags.rst == 1 
 Filters packets with the Reset (RST) flag set — usually part of abnormal connection 
termination. 
 
11. tcp.flags.psh == 1 
 Displays packets with the Push (PSH) flag, indicating data should be pushed to the 
receiving application. 
 
12. dns 
 Shows only packets related to the Domain Name System (typically on port 53). 
 
13. eth.addr == aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 
 Filters all packets where the specified MAC address appears in either source or 
destination. 
 
14. tcp.analysis.retransmission 
 Displays retransmitted TCP packets, helpful in identifying packet loss or delays. 
 
15. tcp.analysis.lost_segment 
 Shows lost TCP segments, which often indicate unreliable connections or congestion. 
 
 
Capture Filters in Wireshark (used before starting capture) 
16. host 172.18.5.4 
 Captures all traffic to and from a specific IP address. 
 
17. net 192.168.0.0/24 
 Captures traffic from a whole subnet — in this case, a typical local network. 
 
18. port 53 
 Captures only DNS traffic, which resolves domain names into IPs. 
 
19. tcp port 80 
 Captures only HTTP traffic, commonly used for unencrypted web access. 
 
20. tcp port 443 
 Captures only HTTPS traffic, commonly used for secure websites. 
 
21. icmp 
 Captures only ICMP packets like ping requests and replies. 
 
22. not arp and not port 53 
 Captures all traffic except ARP and DNS packets. 
 
23. ip 
 Captures only IPv4 traffic, excluding ARP, IPv6, etc. 
 
24. not broadcast and not multicast 
Captures only unicast traffic, ignoring broadcasts and multicasts often used for device 
discovery. 
  
25. tcp and (host youtube.com or host www.youtube.com) 
Captures all TCP traffic to or from YouTube, which is useful while logging into a 
YouTube account.
